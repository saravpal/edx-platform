The edx-platform documentation has undergone several transitions.  Some of these
docs are the latest docs, some were replaced with docs in the Confluence wiki,
and some are now in the edx-documentation repo, and some have moved to other
repos.

The parent docs directory will use now have docs at the root, and will no longer
use "source" directories as is done in this archive.  If you find that any of
the documents in this archive are current, they should be moved out of this
archive directory, dropping the "source" sub-directory.  Using organizational
sub-directories is fine.
